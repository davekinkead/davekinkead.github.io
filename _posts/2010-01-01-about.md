### G’day, I’m Dave.

I spend my time in Brisbane, Australia & the Tirol, Austria.

I ski pow, write code, and read philosophy.

I have degrees in Science, Business and Philosophy.  Probably because I never got a gold star for finger-painting.

I also like beer.

I’m often wrong but always confused.  Feel free to drop me a line some time.  Or don’t.
