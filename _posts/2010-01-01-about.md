I work at the intersection of philosophy and technology.  I'm a computational philosopher at the University of Queensland where I teach critical thinking, and an independent software developer and consultant focusing on Ruby and Javascript.

My research mainly focuses on computational methodologies, philosophical pedagogies, and digital ethics.  My current projects include investigating how we can use computers to do philosophy, the impact of big data & social media on democracy, and the development of computer assisted reasoning tools.

I have degrees in Philosophy, Business, & Science - probably because I never got a gold star for finger-painting.  Aussie by birth, I split my time between Brisbane, Queensland and the Zillertal in Tirol.  

Get in touch any time if you'd like to catch up for chat.
