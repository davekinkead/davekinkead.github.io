Let's start with a not-so-hypothetical question -- _should South East Queensland move to daylight saving?_  How do we answer this question democratically?  One obvious choice is to vote, hold a referendum or pleblicite, and let the people speak.  Or maybe not, as the current debate over marriage equality shows, a public debate over a sensitive issue could easily degenerate into hate speech and do considerable harm, so maybe our elected representatives should simply do their job and represent the people that elected them.

The issue of daylight saving however doesn't seem to have the same toxic possibilities as the marriage equality debate could have.  Queenslanders certainly have strong opinions about whether we should wind our clocks forward an hour every October but it's unlikely that Lifeline will need to setup couselling and suicide prevention services for those vilified for their temporal orientation.  So it's safe to assume that we could hold a public vote without any serious negative consequences -- financial considerations excepted.

So the next question we need to answer is who gets to vote?  The outcome will only be binding on those living in the South East so it seems that residents of Brisbane, the Gold and Sunshine Coasts, Toowoomba etc should have a say.  But what about the rest of the state? Should all Queenslanders be elegible to vote simply because they live in the same state?  An outcome in favour of daylight saving in South East Queensland will effect those in the rest of the state because Queensland will be a state with two time zones [^1]

A quick history of Democracy

Classical - Athens

  - Citizens should enjoy political equality in order to be free to rule and be ruled in turn (unity of ruler & ruled)
  - public/political participation was the only way to live honourable and fulfilled.

Protective - Locke

  - Political participation is an essential condition of personal liberty; if citizens do not rule themselves, they will be dominated by other.
  - democracy is the instrument to protect oneself from arbitrary rule of others


Developmental - Rousseau, Rawls

  - Citizens must enjoy political and economic equality in order that nobody can be master of another and all can enjoy equal freedom and development in the process of self-determination for the common good.
  - democracy has intrinsic value in transforming the character (self expression & development) of citizens


Utilitarian - Mill

  - forces decision-makers to take into account the interests, rights and opinions of most people in society. 
  "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others." -- On Liberty

Epistemic - Mill, Condorcet

  - democracy produces good outcomes

Equality - Singer

  - we all want to be dictators but cant

Deliberative - Cohen, Gutman

  - the authority of democracy is in the Deliberative process
