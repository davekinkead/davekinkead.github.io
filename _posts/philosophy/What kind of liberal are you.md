The term "liberal" is a confusing one.  Is a liberal someone who believes in social freedoms - marriage equality for example - or someone who believes in the primacy of markets over the means of production.  In Australia, conservatives tend to vote Liberal, while in the US liberals would vote for anything but.  "Liberal" and "Liberalism", the political philosophy it is derived from...

At the risk of stating the obvious, a liberal is by definition, anyone who believes in liberty.  All liberals, whether left or right, old or new, agree that liberty and freedom are primary human values - that there is a presumption in favour of liberty, and any restrictions to our freedoms by the state or others must somehow be justified - something Gerry Gaus calls the 'Fundamental Liberal Principle'.

All of us (presumably) believe in this fundamental principle, so how can we as a society diverge so much?  Equality....

One way of understanding freedom made famous by Issiah Berlin is the concept of _negative liberty_.  The central idea here is that we are free so long as no one else stops you from doing what you want.  Outward facing.

But even if we are doing what we want and nobody is stopping us, is it possible to not be free?  Addiction & autonomy.  Inward facing.

The challenge for the autonomous conception of freedom is articulating some criteria of autonomy.  Media & the Matrix

Even if we can be sure we are autonomous, is negative liberty enough?  Generates minimalist govt, leads to inequalities.  Freedom requires the means to obtains ends. Positive freedom.

Not just any ends - fly to the moon.  Ends that others can also achieve.

Conflict exists between positive and negative freedom.

Revival in republican freedom. not being in servitude to another.  Stronger requirements than negative liberty - just the threat is enough - and requires stronger response - large equality of means

Absolute freedom for all is impossible.  Our views on equality will strongly influence our views on freedom.
