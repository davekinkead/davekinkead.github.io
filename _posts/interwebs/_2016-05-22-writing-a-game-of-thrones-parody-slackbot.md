I've always ....

Thankfully, Slack makes integrations really easy....

## The Idea

The plan is deliberately simply: write a bot that listens to channel conversations and responds _intelligently_ and _humourously_.  The criteria for humour should be straight forward - does it generate a laugh.  The intelligence one is more challenging however - not wanting to implement machine learning or AI, I'm going to settle on _a appropriate reponse_.


Let's start with the basic building blocks...we are going to need a way of 

  1. accessing the channel data
  2. parsing and generating a response
  3. responding in the channel
