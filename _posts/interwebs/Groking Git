Groking Git

  - content addressable storage
  - a directed graph
  - git init

Git init generates:

  config
  description
  HEAD
    ref: refs/heads/master
  index (after git add)
  /hooks
  /info
    exclude
      # git ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
      # Lines that start with '#' are comments.
      # For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
      # exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
      # *.[oa]
      # *~
  /objects
    /aa (after first add)
    /info
    /pack
  /refs
    /heads
    /tags
  /logs (after commit)
    HEAD
    /refs
      /heads
        master
