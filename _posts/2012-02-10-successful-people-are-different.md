The Harvard Business Review has shared its latest insights about the [secrets of successful people][hbr].  The maxims include such gems as 'be specific' and 'build your willpower muscle': I guess that's the best one could hope for from a PhD in motivational psychology.

Kind of reminds me of McSweeney's version of the [7 habits of highly successful people][mcsweeney]:

1. Skiing
2. Yachting
3. Snorkeling
4. Golf
5. Polo
6. Dinner parties
7. Shopping

Successful people ARE different. They're successful.
