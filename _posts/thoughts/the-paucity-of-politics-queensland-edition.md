If it's one thing that disturbs me more than reflecting on the last three years of politics in Queensland, it's the thought of the next three years after a LNP victory on Saturday.  Newman, like his federal counterpart, has repeatedly demonstrated his contempt for Queensland though his 

How is it possible that a party that explicitly seeks to benefit a privileged minority at the expense of the rest of the state was voted in in the first place.  How is it possible that a party that .... looks like scraping by with a slim majority come Sunday morning?  While they may have corrupted the independence of the public service, environmental regulation, political transparency.... there's no evidence to suggest that the cancerous rot of self-interest extends to the electoral commission. So how is it that they even in with a chance?

The LNP won the last election because they weren't Labor. Newman won the last election because he wasn't Bligh.  Few Queenslanders vote _for_ the LNP for the simple reason that the LNP no longer represents Queensland. It's become the play thing of big business, developers, and lobbyist.  Its MP's receive more in donations than they do in public funding so it's little wonder that the hand that feeds them is looked after very nicely indeed.

The LNP looks likely to win another term for the simple reason that the opposition is a joke.  There are simply no good options for anyone not on the fringe of either the far left or right.

So Queensland, please don't fuck it up this weekend.  Yes the choice is shitty.  You are being asked to chose between stepping on a dog turd and having putrid excrement stuffed down your throat.  But of the two crappy choices, one is clearly worse than the other.  So vote #1, least shit.

But for some people, the thought of voting for Labor or the Greens is too much.  And in the absence a pixies, unicorns, not-bat-shit-crazy independents, or other mythical creatures, they'll find themselves putting a #1 in the LNP box.  If that is you, then STOP. Put the pencil down, and step away from the voting booth.

Because it is better to vote zero than put a number in the LNP square[^except]. It's better to vote for no one than give any support to another [three years of this](http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/lnp-unanimously-endorses-99year-asset-lease-plan-20141007-10rjy1.html).  Because by voting for no one, you deprive the LNP of any claim to a mandate.

A vote for the LNP is an endorsement of their policies and performance. So if can't bring yourself to vote for anyone else, vote for a better Queensland - Vote Zero.

[^except]: Except of course if you are a CEO, developer, miner, or lobbyist. In that case vote how ever the fuck you want because it doesn't matter, you are going to by the policy you want any way.
