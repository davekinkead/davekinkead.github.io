# The Teacup

## Presenting

The teacup has a distinctly organic form to it - the way its sides bow out from head to foot.  The rubbery grip, a light blue pastel, then adds a functional dash to it's otherwise china white minimalism.

Sipping from it, I'm reminded of days in the garden with my grandma.  The bitter tastes and pungent aroma of the tannins instantly transports me back in time.


## Describing

The teacup has a smooth organic shape to it.  It's white, except for the pastel blue grip that forms a fat stripe across its form.

It is half full with an Earl Grey tea with milk.  The liquid smells of tannins and tastes a little bitter after a long brew.


# Brisbane

## Presenting

Brisbane was once my city.  When I moved here a decade ago, the sleep country town of over a million people had finally embraced its natural geography - especially the river, whose murky waters flowed like a snake through its heart and who had finally become something to celebrate rather than hide.  New cafes, bars and restaurants were popping up almost daily, and this growing cultural vibrancy was matched only by the ease of living here.

Today however, Brisbane is in the grips of growing pains. Roads are congested, public transport is inadequate, and the costs of putting a roof over one's head and feeding one's belly have become prohibitive.  Brisbane is no longer my city.


## Describing

Brisbane is a city near 1.5 million inhabitants situated around an undulating river and protected bay.  The central business district contains a number of tall highrises whereas the majority of the city consists of single story detached houses on quarter acre blocks.

Transport options predominantly centre around private motor vehicles.  There are size primary train lines servicing pre-war suburbs to the CBD, while the river cat ferry services the inner suburbs.

I moved here almost 10 years ago.
