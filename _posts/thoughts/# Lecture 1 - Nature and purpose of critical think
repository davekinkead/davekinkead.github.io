# Lecture 1 - Nature and purpose of critical thinking


## Why do we need critical thinking?

 - bat and ball
 - geometric growth
 - availability biases


## What is thinking?



## How do we think?

dual/multi-process models that distinguish between intuitions and reasoning
system 1 & system 2

  - beliefs we hold intuitively/unconciously
  - beliefs we hold reflectively/consiously

## Why do we think?

  - Mercier & Sperber's claims

## What is critical thinking?

 - a skill
 - a virtue
 - a procedure
 - a standard
 - a product

> “That mode of thinking – about any subject, content, or problem – in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully taking charge of the structures inherent in thinking and imposing intellectual standards upon them.”

-- Richard Paul and Linda Elder. (2001). The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking: Concepts and Tools.

> In layperson’s terms, critical thinking consists of seeing both sides of an issue, being open to new evidence that disconfirms your ideas, reasoning dispassionately, demanding that claims be backed by evidence, deducing and inferring conclusions from available facts, solving problems, and so forth.

-- Willingham, D. T. (2007) Can Critical Thinking Be Taught?, American Educator, Summer,  pp. 8-19

> Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from or generated by: observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.

-- Michael Scriven and Richard Paul. (2003). Defiing Critical Thinking.

> …the ability to recognize inferential connections holding between statements, where this would include the ability to understand the possibility that what we believe might be false and the ability to identify the sorts of evidence that would undermine our beliefs.

-- Mulnix, Jennifer Wilson. “Thinking Critically About Critical Thinking.” Educational Philosophy and Theory (2010).

> Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action. In its exemplary form, it is based on universal intellectual values that transcend subject matter divisions: clarity, accuracy, precision, consistency, relevance, sound evidence, good reasons, depth, breadth, and fairness.

> Critical thinking can be seen as having two components: 1) a set of information and belief generating and processing skills, and 2) the habit, based on intellectual commitment, of using those skills to guide behavior. It is thus to be contrasted with: 1) the mere acquisition and retention of information alone, because it involves a particular way in which information is sought and treated; 2) the mere possession of skills, because it involves the continual use of them; and 3) the mere use of those skills (‘as an exercise’) without acceptance of their results.

### What is the problem with criticial thinking being everything to everyone one?

### How is critical thinking different to creative/difficult/slow thinking?

### Is criticial thinking general in nature or domain specific?  Can critical thinking processes be seperated from domain thinking?

Question this course seeks to help you answer:  How exactly are my beliefs justified?

Descriptive vs Normative



Mulnix's argument

  - CR is a skill that can be developed (or lost)
  - CR is based on the antecedent skill of identifying inferential connections between claims

  > In other words, reasoning well, or thinking critically, consists first in the ability to grasp inferential connections holding between statements in order to see a progression of evidence in the form of an argument to a specified conclusion. (p10)

  > In this sense, critical thinking protects us from sloppy and conformist thinking and insulates us against empty dogmatism and rhetoric. (p10)


> For students to improve, they must engage in critical thinking itself. It is not enough to learn about critical thinking.These strategies are about as effective as working on your tennis game by watching Wimbledon. Unless the students are actively doing the thinking themselves, they will never improve. (Van Gelder, 2005, p. 43)


> Arguments should be sharply distinguished from inferences. An inference is a process the output of which is a representation. An argument is a complex rep- resentation. (Mercier & Sperber p58)

> arguments are the output of one mechanism of intuitive inference among many that delivers intuitions about premise-conclusion relationships. (p59)
