In [The Republic][rep], Plato outlines one of the earliest known taxonomies of political constitutions or forms.  The dialogue between Socrates and ....

What he calls his forms is...

> Aristocracy -> Timocracy -> Oligarchy -> Democracy -> Tyranny

but what he is really describing is...

> Meritocracy -> Stratocracy -> Plutocracy -> Ochlocracy -> Autocracy

By aristocracy (or monarchy in the case of one ruler), Plato means _the rule of the best_ rather than some hereditary class system of privileged that we now associate with the term. The prefect state he describes here is one comprised of three classes - those of gold heart who rule, those of silver heart who enforce and protect, and those of bronze heart who produce and provide for society.

A further difference from our current conception of aristocracy is that the ruling class must be forbidden from holding property or wealth, forbidden from even touching gold or silver [416e].  They're are to be provided for in a manor sufficient for their needs but not so much that their excellence - their wisdom, courage, self-discipline - is diminished.

In short, what he describes is a _meritocracy_ rather than _aristocracy_ in today's parlance.  That only the best should rule is explicit - Socrates says there should be both upward and downward mobility of offspring to ensure the excellence of each class is maintained.

When rule becomes hereditary, or when the philosopher kings and guardian classes are allowed to accumulate wealth, greed infects the virtuous Guardian rulers, and the Guardians demand property and wealth and make the others in society their serfs [547c].  The people will still have respect for authority and the Guardians will still abstain from production, but they will reject the need for intelligence, and prefer war to peace [547e].  

Socrates says he knows no other name for this but _timocracy_ or _rule of the honourable_.  What Plato describes in this dialogue however, is a military state - one where martial abilities are celebrated but the junta rules for own rather than society's benefit.  An while the elite may honourable in the sense that they value virtues like courage and excellence, this more aptly described as a _stratocracy_ or _rule of the military_.
