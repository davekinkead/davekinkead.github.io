## G’day, I’m Dave.

I ski pow, write code, and read philosophy.

I'm an independent technology consultant and a philospher at the University of Queensland.  I hold degrees in Philosophy, Business, & Science.  Probably because I never got a gold star for finger-painting.

I work at the intersection of philosophy and technology where I help organisations build software to better understand their data.  I'm available for technology consulting and training.

Aussie by birth, I now live and work around the world - this month, I'm living in the Zillertal.  Drop me a line if you'd need help with software and critical thinking training and development.  Or if you just want to chat!
