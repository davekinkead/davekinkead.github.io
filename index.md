## G’day, I’m Dave.

I ski pow, write code, and read philosophy.

I'm a philospher at the University of Queensland and an independent technology and strategy consultant.  I hold degrees in Philosophy, Business, & Science.  Probably because I never got a gold star for finger-painting.

Aussie by birth, I now live and work around the world.  Travel is in my blood - this month, I'm living in the Zillertal.

I write and speak about technology, philosophy, and travel.  I’m often wrong and always confused.  After all, epistemic modesty is a good thing ... I think.


## Contact

I'm always interested in hearing about interesting stories or challenging problem. I'm available for technology consulting and training.  Please get in touch.
