## G’day, I’m Dave.

I ski pow, write code, and read philosophy.

I work at the intersection of philosophy and technology as a software developer and philospher at the University of Queensland.

My research mainly focuses on computational methodologies and digital ethics.  I have degrees in Philosophy, Business, & Science - probably because I never got a gold star for finger-painting.

Aussie by birth, I split my time between Brisbane and the Zillertal.  Get in touch any time if you want to chat.
