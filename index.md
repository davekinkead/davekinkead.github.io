G’day, I’m Dave.

I ski pow, [write code](https://github.com/davekinkead){:target="_blank"}, and [read philosophy](/philosophy).

I'm a philospher at the University of Queensland and an independent software consultant with degrees in Philosophy, Business, & Science.  Probably because I never got a gold star for finger-painting. 

Right now, I'm working on [computational approaches to political philsophy](https://github.com/davekinkead/modelling-the-boundary-problem/){:target="_blank"}.

I also like to travel. This week, I'm in [Brisbane](#) <strike>Krabi</strike> <strike>Berlin</strike> <strike>Vienna</strike> [~~Brataslava~~](http://kinkead.com.au/bratislava/) [~~Budapest~~](http://kinkead.com.au/budapest/) [~~Munich~~](http://kinkead.com.au/green-munich/) <strike>Zillertal</strike> <strike>Copenhagen</strike> <strike>Brisbane</strike>.

I try to [write](/thoughts) and [give talks](/talks) as often as possible.  I’m often wrong and always confused.  But that's a good thing. 

I think.
