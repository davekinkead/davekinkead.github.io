Here's how I might be able to help you:


## Rapid Prototyping

You have an idea for a new web application, you've tested the waters, and you might just be onto a winner.  But there's just one problem - you need someone to build it.

The biggest risk with all new technical endeavours is failing to find product-market fit.  The challenge is rarely technical.  Rather, it's a problem of knowledge - at this stage, knowing what to build is more important than knowing how to build it.

Requirements will be vague.  Initial ideas will be off the mark.  Real value will only reveal itself after some wrong turns.   Projects like this require a particular type of application development - agile, focused, and flexible.   New products are littered with unknown unknowns that can only be discovered through trial and error - but a good development strategy can help you avoid many potential product killers.

 By helping you analyse and articulate your vision, I can structure your new application into a series of weekly deliverables that minimise your risk and maximise your time-to-market.  I can't turn your new application into the next Google or Facebook but I can optimise it for success given the constraints of your budget.


## Streamlining Operations

You are storing business information in Excel.  You are emailing, or even worse mailing, forms between teams.  You have computer systems that can't communicate with each other.  You have silos of information that your people need but can't access.

## Enhancing Human Capital
