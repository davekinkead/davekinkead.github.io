### [Modelling the Boundary Problem][1]

This is a work-in-progress on the relationship between democratic inclusion and democratic authority.  It is simultaneously a philosophical argument and computer simulation written in literate coffeescript.

I argue that in order to be legitimate, any instrumental account of democracy must articulate a congruent account of inclusion (but none do).  Furthermore, incompatible accounts of inclusion make certain instrumental justifications of democracy incompatible themselves.

### [What can we infer about school performance?][2]

Assessing teacher and school performance has become increasingly prevalent in many education systems. But directly measuring the causal impact of a school or pedagogy on student academic ability is difficult. Instead, student performance is used as a proxy for school performance.

But what exactly can we infer about school performance from student performance? This is a proof of concept simulation for a paper I plan to write this year.

### [Models of Segregation][3]

A reproduction of Thomas Schelling's seminal 1969 work using agent based modelling with coffeescript, D3.js, and HTML.  In it, I demonstrate Schelling's insight about complex systems in which the interplay of individual choices bear no close relation to individual intent.

### [Computational Philosophy Workshop][4]

A semester long workshop on computational approaches to philosophy covering agent based modelling, game theory, and information theory.  We start of with some basic simulation, move on the dynamic mutli-strategy games, and finish up with information cascades.
