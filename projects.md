### [Modelling the Boundary Problem][1]

This is a work-in-progress paper on the relationship between democratic inclusion and democratic justifications.  It is simultaneously a philosophical argument and computer simulation written in literate coffeescript.

I argue that any instrumental account of democracy must articulate a congruent account of inclusion, but many accounts of inclusion are incompatible with accounts of democracy.

### [What can we infer about school performance?][2]

Assessing teacher and school performance has become increasingly prevalent in many education systems. But directly measuring the causal impact of a school or pedagogy on student academic ability is difficult. Instead, student performance is used as a proxy for school performance.

But what exactly can we infer about school performance from student performance? This is a proof of concept simulation for a paper I plan to write this year.
