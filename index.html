### G’day, I’m Dave.

I ski pow, write code, and read philosophy.

I have degrees in Philosophy, Science, & Business.  Probably because I never got a gold star for finger-painting.  Right now, I'm working on computational approaches to political philsophy.

I like to travel. This week, I'm in 

Brisbane
Krabi
Berlin
Vienna
Brataslava
Budapest
Munich
Zillertal
Copenhagen
Brisbane

I try to write and present ideas.  I’m often wrong and always confused.  But that's a good thing. I think.

I also like beer.  Feel free to drop me a line some time.
